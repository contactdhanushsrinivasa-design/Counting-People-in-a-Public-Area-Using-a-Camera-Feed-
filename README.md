# Counting-People-in-a-Public-Area-Using-a-Camera-Feed-
This project is a real-time computer vision application designed to automate the monitoring and quantification of foot traffic in public spaces.
Unlike traditional manual counting, which is prone to human error and inefficiency, this project leverages Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence to analyze visual data in real-time.
At its core, the system utilizes specialized algorithms—such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)—to detect human features and generate density maps.
