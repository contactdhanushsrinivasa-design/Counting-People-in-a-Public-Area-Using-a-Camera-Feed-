Crowd Counting using Video Analytics" is an advanced computer vision project designed to automate the process of estimating the number of people in a specific area using digital images or video feeds. Unlike traditional manual counting, which is prone to human error and inefficiency, this project leverages Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence to analyze visual data in real-time.
At its core, the system utilizes specialized algorithms—such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)—to detect human features and generate density maps.
